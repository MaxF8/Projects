# Projects
This repository contains notable coding projects I have created. Some of them include:

AWS Summer Project:

Over the summer, along with a small team, I created a "Smart City Reporting System" through AWS. We built functionality for users to report and search for issues in their respective cities. Also, we constructed an employee portal where staff could log in, letting them to take on issues and update data. I led the creation of a modern website UI using Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Finally, we packaged the project in an executable file using Docker, ensuring simple setup access.

Document Store:

Developed a sophisticated Java search engine, storing documents in memory while utilizing several built-from-scratch Data Structures (including a B-tree, Trie, Heap, Hash Table). Implemented dictionary lookup and designed all actions to have undo capability. Programmed to move the least-recently-used document to disk in JSON format when storage limits are exceeded in order to optimize maximum data efficiency
